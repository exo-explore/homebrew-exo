  <<~EOS
    Heads up, you may have seen a 'Failed changing dylib ID' message at the end of the build. We're working on getting an upstream fix.
    Exo is now installed! Launch with 
      exo

    To enable automatic VRAM configuration, run:
      sudo brew services start exo

    This just runs #{libexec}/configure-vram.sh on login
  EOS
  end

  service do
    run [libexec/"exo_configure_mlx"]
    run_type :immediate
    keep_alive false
    log_path var/"log/exo_configure_mlx.log"
    error_log_path var/"log/exo_configure_mlx.log"
  end

  test do
    # `test do` will create, run in and delete a temporary directory.
    #
    # This test will fail and we won't accept that! For Homebrew/homebrew-core
    # this will need to be a test that verifies the functionality of the
    # software. Run the test with `brew test exo`. Options passed
    # to `brew install` such as `--HEAD` also need to be provided to `brew test`.
    #
    # The installed folder is not in the path, so use the entire path to any
    # executables being tested: `system bin/"program", "do", "something"`.
